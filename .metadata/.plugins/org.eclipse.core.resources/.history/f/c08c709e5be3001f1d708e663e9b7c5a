/* 
 	ROHAN LOVES 0 (1)
	Rohan loves 0. He has been assigned a task by his coach to check 
	whether it is possible to find a subarray in the array nums with a sum of 0.
	Rohan thinks that this task is quite easy as he knows the brute-force method, 
	but his coach has strictly instructed him to think of an optimized approach.
	
	1st parameter int [] arr is an array 
	2nd parameter n is the length of array. 
	
	Constraints:

	(1 <=nums.length <= 10^4)
	(-10^4 <=nums[i] <= 10^4)
